1. The synatx of Python and Haskall do not use traditional tokens to determine the language. 
   They use indentation, which can not be represented through finite automata, thus it is not 
   a regular language.

2. In CoffeeScript, whitespace can affect where the arguments of a function starts and ends.
   In Ruby, the space differentiates between an arithematic expression and a function call.
   In the C preprocessor, spaces can help define macro expansions during the preprocessing.

3. Similar to JavaDocs, spaces and comments might be used for documentation of the program and 
   can be used to describe to program to any viewers. It is important that the scanner can 
   detect these comments so they can be used later for documentation.
