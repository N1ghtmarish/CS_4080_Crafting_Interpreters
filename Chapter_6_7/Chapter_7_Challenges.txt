1. Although it is not two different types, there could be comparing numbers, since it would be useful comparing the ASCII values of strings. But otherwise, I do not see the   purpose of comparing something like an int to a string, 3 < "pancake" would be solving what problem? If comparing their ASCII was the goal, then converting 3 to a String would be sufficient but I do not see the purpose of comparing the number 3 with the string "pancake". This is consistent with other languages like Java and C where you can compare two different strings but not a string and a number.


2.
case PLUS:
  if (left instanceof String || right instanceof String) {
return stringify(left) + stringify(right);
  }
  if (left instanceof Double && right instanceof Double) {
return (double)left + (double)right;
  }
throw new RuntimeError(expr.operator, "Operands must be two numbers or two strings.");


3.
It returns infinity or negative infinity. Other languages throw errors
case SLASH:
checkNumberOperands(expr.operator, left, right);
if ((double) right == 0.0) {
throw new RuntimeError(expr.operator, "Division by zero.");
}
return (double) left / (double) right;
