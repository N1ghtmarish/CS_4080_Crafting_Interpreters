1. Although it is not two different types, there could be comparing numbers, since it would be useful comparing the ASCII values of strings. But otherwise, I do not see the   
   purpose of comparing something like an int to a string, 3 < "pancake" would be solving what problem? If comparing their ASCII was the goal, then converting 3 to a String would 
   be sufficient but I do not see the purpose of comparing the number 3 with the string "pancake". This is consistent with other languages like Java and C where you can compare 
   two different strings but not a string and a number. 
3.
